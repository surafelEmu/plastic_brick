                        Waste is now a global problem, and one that must be addressed in order to solve the world's resource and energy challenges. Plastics are made from limited resources such as petroleum, and huge advances are being made in the development of technologies to recycle plastic waste among other resources [1]. Plastics are non-biodegradable, synthetic polymers derived primarily from petro-fossil feedstock and made-up of long chain hydrocarbons with additives and can be moulded into finished products.

                        The design concept consists the following:
a) Maximum volume of the melt needed to fill the mold. This entails length of the screw conveyor (l), diameter of the barrel (d), melt density (ρm) and melt mass (m);
b) Design of barrel which entails diameter of the barrel.
c) Design for screw conveyor.
While the design analysis entails the following units:
a) The Extruder unit comprises of the hopper, barrel, band heater, nozzle, screw conveyor, bearing housing and gear box
b) The clamping unit consists of the mold and clamping for locking device.
c) The electrical panel comprises of temperature control box, and thermocouple.

                        The business model of Eco-Bricks is set on three main principles: education, environmental conservation, and economic development. Collecting and recycling plastic waste as well as manufacturing it into eco-bricks is the company’s core business. Selling recyclable waste to other businesses and offering waste collection services are also core to the business model.

                    The major impact of plastic bags on the environment is that it takes many years to for them to decompose. In addition, toxic substances are released into the soil when plastic bags perish under sunlight and, if plastic bags are burned, they release a toxic substance into the air causing ambient air pollution.
